# Decision: Plan Gate

**Timestamp**: 2026-02-04T12:15:00Z
**Gate**: "Is this the right breakdown?"
**Response**: approved

## User Feedback
Clarified that monolithic entity.ejs.t is being replaced (not kept), with new combined.ejs.t that composes from individual templates. User confirmed this matches intent and approved proceeding.

## Adjustments Made
- Issue 3 updated to include 7 templates (added index.ejs.t and combined.ejs.t)
- Clarified that monolithic OUTPUT mode is preserved, just implemented via composition
