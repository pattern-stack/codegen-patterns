/**
 * Delete Organization Command
 * Generated by entity codegen - do not edit directly
 *
 * EXTENSION POINTS (add business logic here):
 * - Authorization: Check if user can delete this specific record
 * - Referential integrity: Check for dependent records, cascade or block
 * - Soft delete: Mark as deleted instead of hard delete
 * - Side effects: Emit events, clean up related data, notify subscribers
 * - Audit: Log deletion for compliance/debugging
